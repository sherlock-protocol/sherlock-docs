One of the biggest features we’ve implemented on the protocol payment side is allowing protocols to pay with essentially whatever token they want. Many protocols aren’t in a financial position where they are holding large amounts of ETH or DAI that they can use to pay for insurance. But many protocols have a governance token that they either hold a lot of or can create more of in order to pay for insurance. They wouldn’t want to sell their governance token to buy ETH or DAI because that would put some pressure on their token’s price. So we allow protocols to pay with the token or tokens of their choice (assuming a minimum threshold of legitimacy, liquidity, etc.). We may end up requiring some percent of the premium to be paid in ETH or DAI, but that can be negotiated later.
