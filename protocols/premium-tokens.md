# Premium Tokens

One of the most important features in Sherlock's protocol design is the ability for protocols to pay with essentially whatever token they want \(or a combination of tokens\). Many protocols aren’t in a financial position where they are holding large amounts of ETH or DAI that they can use to pay premiums. But many protocols have a governance token that they either hold a lot of or can create more of in order to pay premiums.

In addition, protocols wouldn’t want to sell their governance token to buy ETH or DAI because that would put some pressure on their token’s price. So Sherlock's design allows protocols to pay with the token or tokens of their choice \(assuming a minimum threshold of legitimacy, liquidity, etc. and whitelisted by Sherlock\).

It is likely that Sherlock will still require some % of protocol premiums to be paid in ETH or DAI, but the breakdown will be decided at a future date.
