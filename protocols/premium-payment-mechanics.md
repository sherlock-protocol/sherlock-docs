There will be two inputs that are sent on-chain (from off-chain) for protocol payments:

1. The amount of tokens that a protocol is paying block-by-block
2. The price of the tokens

These values will be updated once a week (for gas efficiency) to ensure the amount of tokens a protocol is paying is roughly in line with the % fee charged on the USD value being covered. Because the token a protocol is paying with (maybe their governance token) will likely be different from the tokens in the protocol’s smart contracts that we are covering, it’s likely that a protocol’s payment (in USD terms) will not perfectly match the stated premium (in USD terms) as the token prices fluctuate over the course of the week. If the ratio moves off target in either direction by +/- 10%, Sherlock governance will trigger a mid-week update to make sure the per-block payment is in line again.

#### Examples of mid-week updates
If the protocol payment token has a negative 10% move relative to the tokens Sherlock is covering for that protocol (in the protocol's smart contracts), Sherlock stakers are not getting fully compensated for the risk they are taking. If a protocol payment token has a positive 10% move against the tokens Sherlock is covering for that protocol, then a protocol is paying too much relative to the agreed-upon premium. These token price moves will be automatically monitored off-chain and a script will update the protocol payment amount (both the amount and price fields) on-chain if the prices diverge by a pre-defined threshold (e.g. +/- 10%). This also applies to TVL. If Sherlock comes to an agreement with a protocol to cover a certain pool for them (instead of a $ amount) and the TVL of that pool changes by a material amount (e.g. due to a whale staking/withdrawing), then Sherlock will update the protocol payment amount to reflect the increased or decreased TVL.
