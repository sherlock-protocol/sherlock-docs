When a hack is thought to have occurred, we will work with the protocol to determine the nature of the exploit. Our security experts and the protocol’s core dev team will work together to uncover as much information as possible about the hack (once the threat itself has been neutralized). Ultimately, the decision around the nature of the hack and the payout will be determined by our claims committee.

They will use information provided by our security experts and the protocol’s dev team as well as conduct their own analysis about the nature of the attack. They will then determine what “type” of hack it was and whether it falls under a coverage bucket that the protocol purchased (using the initially agreed-upon coverage agreements). If the hack does not fall under coverage, there is no more immediate action to be taken. If the hack does fall under coverage, we will work with the protocol to determine the exact $ amount to be repaid.

The initial coverage agreement will also specify the token we will repay the hacked protocol with. As described in the staker hack scenario, we will pay the protocol (beyond the value of their deductible) with funds from our “first-money-out” pool to begin with, and finally from the staker pools themselves. Each dollar value of token in each staker pool will be equally discounted to pay back the hack.

For example, if we have staker pools with $10M DAI in one and $40M ETH in the other and we need to repay a $5M hack, we will take $1M from the DAI pool and $4M from the ETH pool. We will swap these currencies into the agreed-upon currency to repay the hacked protocol and then either send the owed amount directly to the protocol or, if the protocol might still be compromised, we could send the money directly to affected accounts.
