Before we engage with a protocol, we do a security assessment to determine the price we feel comfortable charging that protocol for hack coverage. A big part of this assessment will be determined by the coverage agreements we draft with the protocol. We will outline exactly the different types of risks that we can cover (smart contract bugs, oracle manipulation, etc.) and give the protocols some sense of how expensive each type of coverage is relative to the whole. Then protocols will choose exactly the types of risk they want coverage for and the types of risk they don’t want coverage for. They can also choose the deductible they’d like to commit to (if any).

**Side note on protocol deductibles:** The deductible is simply a $ value of money the protocol agrees to set aside (outside of Sherlock) to compensate for hacks. We may end up doing a dynamic calculation here to decide on the protocol payment amount (the weekly on-chain update), but to begin with we’ll likely have them commit to a $ value deductible and charge more if that deductible ends up going below the $ value they committed to. 

Once we know the risks a protocol would like coverage for and we know the deductible amount, we just need to conduct our initial security assessment to decide the starting price for coverage. Our security assessment will be continuous because our security experts will be incentivized to keep protocols safe over time. This means that the price we charge protocols may fluctuate over time as a protocol takes actions that make it less risky or more risky. Hopefully we’ll be working closely with protocols to instill more robust development practices over time which will lower those protocols’ premiums over time as well.
