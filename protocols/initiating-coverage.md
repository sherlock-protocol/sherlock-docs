We believe any protocol with funds locked in its smart contracts for any period of time can lose those funds due to a hack. Therefore, we believe any such protocol can benefit from insurance. Once we’ve come to an initial agreement around what types of coverage a protocol is looking for (the coverage agreement), we can begin our security assessment. We won’t go into the details of an assessment here, but it will likely take a few days to a few weeks and it will assess not only the risk of hacks to smart contracts (and smart contract bugs), but also assess areas like the development practices of the team, the risk management processes built into the protocol and the safety of protocols that said protocol interfaces with.

From this assessment, our security and risk teams will agree on a price we’d be comfortable charging the protocol. Our security and risk teams will mostly come up with the “floor” price or the lowest price at which they would feel comfortable insuring a certain protocol.

We’ll also agree on the dollar value to be insured. If the protocol’s TVL is $500M, maybe they will want $500M to be covered or maybe they will only have a special $100M pool that they want covered. For Sherlock, we need to make sure the size of our insurance pool is bigger than the $ value the protocol wants covered. For any singular protocol, we need to be able to repay the entire amount of coverage on any given block.

For example, a protocol comes to us and wants $100M covered. We would need to have at least $100M in our insurance pool, otherwise we’d have to come to a different agreement with the protocol. On top of that, the $ value we would cover will likely be in different currencies than the currencies in our pool. Because of this, we implement a buffer amount (20% currently) to account for currency fluctuations. So if we’re going to cover a protocol for $100M, we need to have at least $120M in our insurance pool ($100M we need to cover + 20% buffer).
