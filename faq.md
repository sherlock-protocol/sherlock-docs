# FAQ

## General

### What is Sherlock?

* Sherlock is a risk management platform designed to provide protocols with affordable, reliable coverage against smart contract exploits. Anyone can stake in our staking pools and we aim to offer the highest risk-adjusted return in DeFi. This is made possible by our expert smart contract security team, who reviews and prices coverage for every protocol we take on and has “skin-in-the-game” alongside our stakers.

### How is it different from other risk management protocols?

* We think existing solutions have failed to scale for two major reasons: 1\) Poor user experience and 2\) high prices. 1\) DeFi users don't like buying exploit coverage which is why we don’t make you do it. We cover protocols wholesale so users don’t need to worry. 2\) Existing protocols outsource pricing by either making users decide which protocols are safe or by relying on utilization. We have a team of expert smart contract security analysts who price our coverage and have “skin in the game” alongside our stakers.

### How does staking work?

* A user stakes into the Sherlock staking pools and receives a market-leading yield comprised of protocol premiums, SHER token incentives, and lending platform rates. These pools cover the risk of smart contract exploits among our partner protocols and can be slashed in the event of an exploit. There is currently a 7-day cooldown period to unstake funds from the pool.

### How can I get coverage as a protocol?

* We are currently in beta with a select number of protocols. Please email us at contact@sherlock.xyz to join the waitlist.
