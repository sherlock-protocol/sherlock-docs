The on-chain mechanism for the security team payout is not very complex. When we take on a new protocol, we decide on a % of the fees that will be allocated to the security team. This will likely be in the range of 10-20% of the total fees paid to Sherlock. That payment will accrue into a special pool which governance can transfer to a governance-controlled address at any time by calling a transfer function. The rest of the payout factors (tranched vesting schedule, implied hack values, etc.) will be calculated off-chain and payments will be made on a scheduled basis off-chain (likely on-chain actually but just not using our smart contracts). Again, we want to keep the security bar very high to begin with, which is why we are starting out a bit centralized in this area. Because of this, the code complexity for security team payouts is extremely low.
