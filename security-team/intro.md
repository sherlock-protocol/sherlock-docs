The Sherlock smart contract security team will assess protocol risk and play a role in pricing the insurance we provide to protocols. Eventually we want this function to be taken on by many different insurance teams in a decentralized manner. But for now, we are keeping the security function centralized and in-house. This is so we can quickly pivot/iterate on the model in a nimble way without being locked in a specific decentralized path. It also ensures we can cultivate a certain quality of security talent that uses our best practices and has been trained in a specific way. Over time, we believe stakers will exhibit a certain level of tolerance for trying out unproven security teams (in a decentralized, multi-team model) but at the start we want to uphold the highest security standards possible and minimize “unforced errors” in terms of security assessment so we can prove out the viability and economics of our model.
