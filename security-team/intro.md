# Intro

The Sherlock smart contract security team will assess protocol risk and assist in pricing the coverage for protocols. At the start, Sherlock will experiment with a few different approaches to assessing risk and securing covered protocols. Sherlock will likely employ full-time security experts and as well as prove out a decentralized security model during the scaling process.

There are pros and cons to both in-house security analysis as well as accessing ad-hoc talent in a more decentralized way. Hat tip to Code 423n4 for showing that security talent can be successfully utilized \(to great effect\) in a more decentralized and ad-hoc model. Sherlock plans to experiment with similar approaches in order to get the best talent looking at our covered protocols.

While Sherlock proves out decentralized models, the in-house security experts will be the backbone of the platform. Especially early on, we expect these experts to gain meaningful amounts of Sherlock equity/tokens which will incentivize them to triangulate the best approaches to keeping protocols secure as well as pricing them accurately. This can be done even as we prove out different iterations of decentralized approaches to security.
