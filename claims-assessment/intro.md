Claim payouts will be decided by our claims committee. This committee will be made up of Sherlock governance participants as well as prominent researchers in the security space who are NOT affiliated with the Sherlock security team. We believe governance participants are incentivized to make the right decision for the future of the Sherlock protocol and prominent researchers will be unbiased third parties who have the technical expertise to classify potential claims.
