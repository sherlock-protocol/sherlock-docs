Because we want our lockTokens (for example lockETH) to be ERC-20 compatible, we need them to be fungible. The lockTokens will accrue certain amounts of interest (SherX) based on how long they have been staked in the pool. If you transfer lockTokens that have been in the pool for 1 year to a friend, those lockTokens will be “owed” more SherX than lockTokens that were staked yesterday. The varying amounts of SherX owed to different lockTokens make lockTokens non-fungible. In order to fix this, we implement some logic on lockToken transfers. Basically, we remove all the SherX associated with a lockToken on a transfer event. We don’t burn the SherX, we move it to the SherX staker pool and we simply mint the sender address the corresponding amount of lockSherX. We don’t send the owed SherX directly to the sender because this could be a way to “game” our protocol and get your SherX out immediately.
