When a hack occurs, a staker’s funds are at risk of being liquidated to repay the hack. There is no minimum “slashing” percentage that a staker can lose from a single hack. For example, if a staker stakes 100 ETH in our pool and a massive hack occurs, they could lose all of their 100 ETH. In mechanisms such as Aave’s Safety Module, a single hack could only claim 30 ETH from the same staker (there’s a 30% slashing limit). We may end up implementing something like a 50% slashing limit but it comes with a large downside which would be 2x less capital efficiency and the ability to only cover ½ of the TVL we could otherwise cover for a protocol. For example, if our pool is $100M in size and we cover a pool at a protocol for $100M (this is a simplified example), we can cover the entire pool. If we implement a 50% slashing limit, we now only have $50M available to cover the same pool. So we would only be able to guarantee coverage for $50M worth of the $100M pool. Maybe a protocol wouldn’t even sign up to use us at that point. In addition, our capital efficiency is effectively cut in half. The interest rate we’re able to offer stakers also gets effectively cut in half (the insurance fees portion). And the only thing we accomplish by implementing a slashing limit is protecting stakers from extremely large hacks ($100M in this example) at a single protocol. If multiple protocols experience medium sized hacks -- 5 protocols get hacked for $20M in a short timeframe, our stakers would still lose all of their stake in that example (because slashing only protects from large hacks at a single protocol). Especially as we are bootstrapping, we don’t think it makes sense to implement a slashing limit, we want to have maximum capital efficiency as we’re growing quickly. We think the combination of a fair APY for staking, the aligned incentives of the security team, the low likelihood of a very large hack event, our first-money out pool, and a protocol’s own deductible will give stakers enough comfort to stake their funds into our protocol without a slashing limit.

#### Exploit payout mechanics
When a hack is rumored to have occurred, the clock starts for the Sherlock team to identify, verify and pay out a hack in 7 days (or whatever timeframe we choose for the cooldown). We expect the covered protocol to notify us of the hack (our security team will likely find out concurrently with the protocol’s dev team) and then we will work to understand the cause and type of the hack. Once the nature of the hack is agreed upon, a decision will be made by our claims committee as to whether the hack falls under coverage or not. If it does not, no further action is taken. If it does, we work with the protocol to understand the dollar value of the hack and what the best avenue for payment will be (pay the covered protocol directly and have them reimburse their users or pay their users directly, etc.). Once this is decided, we will see how much (if any) of the payout will be reimbursed by the covered protocol’s own deductible. After the deductible funds are used up, we move to the Sherlock “first money out” pool. This pool will be made up of “protocol-controlled value” i.e. any funds Sherlock has raised (through SHER sales or fees earned) which we’ve staked into our insurance pool. To make staking even more attractive, we decided any money Sherlock stakes should be junior to the rest of the stakers in terms of payout (hence the name “first money out” pool). If the deductible and first-money-out pool can’t cover the entirety of the hack, staker funds will be used. Each staker pool will have a function to withdraw funds for a hack payout. We will do an off-chain calculation to decide how much of each pool should be withdrawn in order to pay out a hack proportionally from each staker (i.e. every dollar-worth of tokens in every pool becomes 90 cents for example). With each protocol, we will have decided what the token type (ETH for example) of the payout should be when drafting their coverage agreement. We will then take the tokens we’ve collected from each staker pool (ETH, DAI, USDC, etc.) and swap them into ETH (or whichever token type was agreed upon). Then we will send the funds to the protocol or to the affected users. This will depend on the hack type and our agreement with the protocol -- for special hack situations like admin keys being stolen or a hacked protocol that is still insecure -- we will stipulate to compensate user addresses directly since the integrity of the compromised protocol could still be uncertain.
