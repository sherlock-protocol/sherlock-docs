If a staker stakes ETH into our insurance pool, they will start earning SherX tokens. These SherX tokens will accrue in our pool. They don’t physically accrue since we haven’t minted them yet, but our internal accounting will accrue them block-by-block to the ETH pool and thus proportionally to any ETH staker. SherX tokens in the pool will be at risk for hacks. They will also be included in our insurance pool’s size calculation. The only difference between SherX interest and staked tokens is that users are not compensated for keeping SherX tokens in our pool (they aren’t paid SherX on their SherX). It’s actually in a staker’s best interest to withdraw their SherX tokens as soon as possible (since they are at risk for hack payouts but not being rewarded).

Because of this dynamic, we have a harvest function where users can transfer their SherX into the SherX pool, where they will earn SherX on their staked SherX. The harvest function makes it so a staker doesn’t have to wait 7 days (due to the cooldown) to unstake their SherX tokens and then restake them. They can start earning SherX on their previously earned SherX immediately -- they just have to pay gas to call the harvest function.
