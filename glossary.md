## Sherlock Terminology

#### Cooldown
- In order to remove a "stake" from the insurance pool, a user must first activate the cooldown period. This period represents the time between the activation or intention to remove the stake and the time at which the stake is actually released from the protocol.

#### lockToken
- The token that represents a staker's proportional stake in the Sherlock insurance pool. See the "lockToken" section under the "Tokens" header for more info.

#### Premium
- The amount a protocol pays Sherlock. In return, Sherlock reimburses covered exploits experienced by the protocol.

#### SHER
- Sherlock's governance token. See the "SHER" section under the "Tokens" header for more info.

#### SHERX
- A tokenized version of interest paid to stakers due to protocol premiums. See the "SHERX" section under the "Tokens" header for more info.

#### Staking
- The act of depositing money into the Sherlock insurance pool. Once money has been deposited, tokens accrue to the depositor's address in the form of APY. All money in the insurance pool is at risk of being liquidated due to an exploit at one of the protocols covered by Sherlock.

#### Unstaking
- The act of removing money from the Sherlock insurance pool. This action can only be taken once the cooldown period for the stake has expired.
