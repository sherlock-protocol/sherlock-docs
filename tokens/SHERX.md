SHERX is essentially tokenized "interest" payments to stakers from protocols. Protocols can pay premiums to Sherlock in an assortment of tokens. Instead of paying interest to stakers in 20 different tokens, SHERX is essentially a "packaged" version of the 20 tokens being paid as interest.

It would be very gas-intensive to pay stakers in many different token types. As an alternative, the SHERX token was created to represent the many different token types paid by protocols. This way, stakers are transferred one token (SHERX) instead of 10 or 20 different tokens.

**Important:** SHERX will always be redeemable for its underlying collateral (the 10 or 20 different tokens) so it will always have intrinsic value.
