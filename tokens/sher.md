# SHER

SHER token is the governance token for the Sherlock protocol. The governance functions of the SHER token will increase over time as the protocol matures. In the short-term, SHER token will be used for added incentives to stakers in staking pools as well as for compensation to the security team.

Allowing staking into a staking pool with SHER tokens is not a god idea for two reasons:

1. As stakers in the staking pools, SHER holders will be biased to favor stakers over protocols which could hurt their objectivity in making good decisions for the Sherlock protocol as a whole.
2. In the event of an exploit at one of our covered protocols, it's reasonable to assume SHER might drop in price. For this reason, SHER is not well-suited to being collateral in the staking pools.
