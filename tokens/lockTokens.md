# lockTokens

A lockToken is simply the "receipt" for staking a certain token with Sherlock.

For example, if a staker stakes 100 ETH into Sherlock's staking pools, the staker would receive a certain amount of lockETH in return. The lockETH represents the staker's proportional stake in the ETH pool. A staker's lockETH balance will not necessarily correspond 1:1 with the amount of ETH staked. For example, 20 lockETH could correspond to 100 ETH.

LockETH (or any other lockToken) is fungible and ERC-20 compatible.
